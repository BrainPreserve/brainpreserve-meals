Gruyère Cheese,"A type of Swiss cheese, fermented by Propionibacteria which produce propionic acid (a short-chain fatty acid). Gruyère contains minimal lactose and possibly some residual bacterial metabolites beneficial for gut health (propionate from cheese fermentation may have colon health benefits). Not directly linked to cognitive benefits; like other cheeses, should be limited for brain-heart health due to saturated fat.","Rich in calcium and phosphorus for bone health; also provides vitamin A and B12. Propionibacteria in Swiss-type cheeses produce vitamin B12 and propionate, which in the gut can serve as an energy source for colon cells. Swiss cheese consumption in moderation hasn’t been associated with the same cardiovascular risk as butter, possibly due to calcium content binding fats and the probiotic factor. Still, high sodium and fat content mean small portions are advisable.",≤1 serving per week,Postbiotic (fermented dairy)
Hazelnuts,"Hazelnuts contain fiber and polyphenols (especially in the skin) that feed gut microbes. They are also rich in vitamin E, folate, and arginine, all supportive of brain health. Including hazelnuts in the diet improves overall diet quality; one study found older adults who ate nuts (including hazelnuts) had better cognitive scores.","Hazelnuts significantly improve antioxidant capacity in the body – regular consumption raises vitamin E levels, which protect LDL from oxidation. Studies show hazelnuts can lower LDL and total cholesterol and improve endothelial function (due to their high MUFA and arginine content). They also provide magnesium and potassium, aiding blood pressure control.",1 oz (about 20 nuts) 3–5x per week,Prebiotic (fiber)
Heirloom Corn,"Heritage varieties of corn (blue, red, purple corn, etc.) often have higher polyphenol content than modern yellow corn. These polyphenols (anthocyanins, phenolics) plus fiber act as prebiotics and antioxidants. Diets using whole heirloom corn (e.g., in traditional Latin American dishes) have been linked to metabolic health which supports cognitive health.","Typically less processed and more nutritious than hybridized sweet corn. Provides fiber for heart health and unique antioxidants that can reduce inflammation. For example, purple corn has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve insulin sensitivity in animal studies.

Herring,"Herring is a fatty fish loaded with omega-3 DHA and EPA. DHA is crucial for brain structure and function; higher omega-3 status is associated with better cognitive aging and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Additionally, fermented herring (pickled) can introduce probiotics (though often pickled in vinegar which kills bacteria). Mainly, herring’s omega-3s increase production of anti-inflammatory metabolites in the gut and brain.","Herring offers cardioprotective benefits – it can raise HDL and lower triglycerides substantially due to omega-3 content. It’s also a top source of vitamin D and B12, supporting bone health and energy metabolism. If pickled in traditional ways, can be high in sodium, but otherwise fresh/smoked herring is very heart-healthy. Regular consumption of oily fish like herring is associated with ~36% reduction in cardiac death.",≥1 serving oily fish per week (3–4 oz),N/A (omega-3 source)
Hominy Corn,"Hominy is corn treated with lime (nixtamalization), which improves its nutrient availability (more B3, calcium). As a whole kernel, hominy has fiber that supports gut microbes. It’s a component of traditional diets (like in pozole) that have sustained cognitive health historically, but direct evidence is sparse. Still, as a whole grain, it contributes to the fiber-cognition link.","Nixtamalized corn has a lower glycemic index than refined cornmeal and provides calcium from the lime. It is also easier to digest. Hominy-based diets historically show lower pellagra incidence due to increased niacin. In moderation, hominy can be part of a heart-healthy diet; it’s usually canned with salt, so rinse to reduce sodium. Overall contributes to whole-grain intake beneficial for heart and metabolic health.","½ cup (cooked) as a starch, a few times per week",Prebiotic (fiber)
Honey,"Honey is not a prebiotic fiber, but it contains oligosaccharides and polyphenols that can modulate gut bacteria (some studies show honey encourages Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria). Certain raw honeys also contain probiotic bacteria. In one small trial, daily honey improved aspects of memory in postmenopausal women compared to hormone therapy. Antioxidants in honey might reduce oxidative brain stress.","Natural anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. Honey can soothe coughs and is easier on blood sugar than refined sugar (slightly lower glycemic due to fructose content).

Miso,"Miso is a fermented soybean paste rich in probiotic organisms (if unpasteurized) such as Lactobacilli and Aspergillus oryzae. Even when added to hot soup (some microbes might die), it provides postbiotic metabolites (peptides, isoflavone aglycones) that reduce inflammation. Regular miso consumption in Japanese diet is associated with lower rates of cognitive impairment, potentially due to vascular benefits of soy and fermentation peptides.",Miso soup intake is linked to reduced gastric cancer risk (despite salt content) possibly due to protective fermentation compounds. Fermented soy in miso can lower blood pressure (ACE-inhibiting peptides) and improve cholesterol profiles. It’s a good source of vitamin K₂ and antioxidants like ferulic acid. High sodium is a concern – but some evidence suggests miso’s salts may have less hypertensive effect than plain salt (possibly due to accompanying nutrients). Use lower-sodium miso or small amounts for flavor.,1 Tbsp miso in soup or dressing 2–3x/week (watch sodium; do not boil to preserve probiotics),Probiotic (fermented soy)
Mozzarella Cheese(fermented),"If traditionally cultured, fresh mozzarella has live lactic acid bacteria (though in smaller numbers compared to yogurt). It is a young cheese, so some active cultures may remain. No specific cognitive benefit known, but as part of a Mediterranean diet (e.g., in caprese salad), it can fit without adverse effect. Offers protein beneficial for neurotransmitter production.","Mozzarella (especially part-skim) is lower in fat and sodium than many cheeses. Good source of calcium and protein. Its probiotics (if present) can support gut health; one study found mozzarella’s Lactobacillus survived digestion better than other cheese strains due to the moist matrix. Being mild, it pairs well with tomatoes/olive oil which have their own health benefits. Overall, a reasonable cheese choice in moderation for cardiovascular health.","1–2 oz a few times per week (prefer fresh, lower-sodium varieties)",Probiotic (fermented dairy)
Mulberries (Dried),"Dried mulberries retain fiber and polyphenols, albeit with more concentrated sugars. They still act as a prebiotic snack, potentially increasing bifidobacteria. Some small studies suggest dried mulberry can improve cognitive function indirectly by lowering HbA1c in diabetics (better glycemic control = better cognitive outcomes).","Dried mulberries are relatively lower in sugar compared to other dried fruits and provide iron, vitamin C, and potassium. They have been observed to lower total cholesterol and inflammation in a small clinical trial. As a snack, they offer a sweet taste with nutrients and fiber, making them preferable to candy. Ensure no added sweetener in commercial products.","2 tbsp dried mulberries as a snack, 2–3x/week",Prebiotic (fiber+polyphenols)
Mulberries(Fresh),Mulberries are rich in anthocyanins (especially dark varieties) and fiber. These support gut bacteria and have been used in traditional medicine for brain tonic effects. Their resveratrol and DNJ (1-deoxynojirimycin) content may improve cognitive function by improving metabolic health (DNJ helps regulate blood sugar). There is emerging research that mulberry extracts can protect neurons in models of Parkinson’s disease via anti-inflammatory mechanisms.,"They help regulate blood sugar – mulberries can inhibit carbohydrate breakdown (due to DNJ), useful in diabetes management. High vitamin C and iron content support immune health and anemia. Regular mulberry intake can improve lipid profiles and reduce fatty liver. Also noted for anti-aging effects on skin. White mulberry supplements are popular for blood sugar control. Fresh mulberries are delicate but very nutritious.",½ cup fresh in season or 2 tbsp dried (no sugar added) weekly,Prebiotic (fiber+polyphenols)
Mung Beans,"Mung beans are notable for their prebiotic polysaccharides; in fermented form (e.g., sprouts), they encourage Lactobacilli growth. Animal studies have shown improved learning and memory with mung bean extracts, attributed to reduced oxidative stress and AChE inhibitory activity. In human diets, replacing refined grains with mung bean (as starch or noodles) lowers glycemic load, benefiting cognitive function indirectly.","Mung beans have remarkable cholesterol-lowering effects – a meta-analysis found significant reductions in LDL with daily mung bean intake (often as sprouts or soup). They are rich in folate and magnesium, supporting heart health. Also contain polyphenols (vitexin, isovitexin) that are anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic. Mung bean soup is used in Asia for cooling (anti-inflammatory) properties. Sprouts add vitamin C. Overall excellent for metabolic syndrome improvement.",2–3 servings per week (½ cup cooked or 1 cup sprouts each),Prebiotic (fiber)
Mushrooms,"Many edible mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, maitake, etc.) contain prebiotic polysaccharides like β-glucans that nourish gut microbes and enhance production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Mushroom consumption has been associated with reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment – a study in seniors found those eating >2 servings/week had 50% lower odds of MCI. Likely due to ergothioneine and other antioxidants that protect neurons, plus the microbiome effects.","Mushrooms boost immunity (β-glucans stimulate immune cells) and have cholesterol-lowering effects (e.g., oyster mushrooms contain lovastatin-like compounds). They provide vitamin D2 (especially UV-exposed mushrooms), selenium, and B-vitamins. Mushrooms are also being studied for anti-cancer properties (e.g., shiitake lentinan). As a low-calorie, high-fiber food, they aid weight management. Culinary mushrooms also contribute umami flavor, helping reduce added salt in recipes.",≥2 servings per week (½ cup cooked per serving or ~3 oz),Prebiotic (polysaccharides)
Mustard Greens,"Similar to kale/collards, mustard greens are high-fiber, nutrient-packed leafy greens. They support a healthy microbiome and provide glucosinolates that reduce inflammation. Their peppery flavor comes from isothiocyanates, compounds which have been shown to protect neurons in animal models of stroke. Regular consumption of leafy brassica greens correlates with slower cognitive decline.","Mustard greens are rich in vitamin K, C, and A, supporting bone health and immunity. They help detoxify the body by activating liver enzymes. Also known to have cholesterol-lowering ability by binding bile acids (especially when steamed). Contain folate and B6, which reduce homocysteine levels (beneficial for heart). Their strong flavor can help in reducing the need for added fats or salts in a dish.",≥6 servings leafy greens/week (can alternate types),Prebiotic (fiber)
Natto,"Natto is fermented soybeans (with Bacillus subtilis). It is exceptionally high in vitamin K₂ and nattokinase enzyme. Natto’s Bacillus is a spore-forming probiotic that can survive GI passage. Regular natto consumption has been associated with better bone health and possibly better cognitive function in Japan (though cognitive data is limited). The idea is that nattokinase improves blood flow (by breaking down fibrin), potentially benefiting brain circulation.","Extremely heart-healthy: natto consumption correlates with reduced cardiovascular mortality, likely due to its blood-thinning nattokinase and high K₂ which prevents arterial calcification. Probiotic Bacillus in natto can support gut health and immunity. Also provides complete plant protein. Its strong smell/slimy texture can be off-putting, but those who eat it regularly have lower blood pressure and clotting risk. Caution if on blood thinners.",~50g (1 small pack) a few times per week (traditional breakfast in Japan),Probiotic (fermented soy)
Navy Beans,"A type of small white bean extremely rich in fiber (one of the highest fiber beans). They act as prebiotics, promoting SCFA production that can reduce neuroinflammation. B-vitamin and mineral content (folate, magnesium) support cognitive function. Diets high in legumes like navy beans have been linked to significantly better cognitive test scores in older populations (likely via vascular risk reduction).",Navy beans strongly improve lipid profiles and glycemic control. They are part of the “Portfolio Diet” for cholesterol lowering (can reduce LDL ~5% or more). High in folate for reducing homocysteine and supporting heart health. Also an excellent source of plant protein and iron. Regular bean intake (including navy) is associated with lower blood pressure due to potassium and less sodium in the diet.,≥3 servings per week (1/2 cup cooked),Prebiotic (fiber)
Oat-based Bars,"If made primarily of oats (not too much added sugar), these bars provide β-glucan soluble fiber which acts as a prebiotic and has been associated with improved gut permeability and reduced inflammation. Consuming oat β-glucans can also improve cognitive function indirectly via cholesterol lowering and improved cerebrovascular health. Choose bars with nuts/fruits for added brain nutrients.","Oat β-glucan is proven to lower LDL cholesterol (3g/day can lower LDL by ~5-7%). Oats also help stabilize blood sugar and maintain a healthy weight. Oat bars can be convenient sources of iron and whole-grain energy. However, watch out for high sugar content; look for bars with minimal added sugars and natural ingredients. Some oat bars also contain prebiotic fibers like inulin or added seeds, boosting their overall health profile.","1 bar (≈30–40g) per day as snack or breakfast (ensure ≥3g fiber, <5g sugar)","Prebiotic (fiber, β-glucan)"
Oats/Groats/Steel Cut/Rolled,"Oats are one of the best whole grains for microbiome and brain health. Rich in β-glucan prebiotic fiber that increases butyrate-producing gut bacteria. Oat consumption is linked to better cognitive performance through improved cardiovascular health (lower cholesterol) and possibly direct gut-brain communication (SCFAs from oat fermentation reduce neuroinflammation). Steel-cut and groats are less processed, retaining more nutrients.","Strong evidence for cardiovascular benefits: oats consistently lower LDL and total cholesterol. They improve endothelial function and reduce arterial plaque formation. Oats also aid blood sugar control due to viscous fiber slowing carbohydrate absorption. Additionally, they are naturally gluten-free (if uncontaminated), and contain unique antioxidants (avenanthramides) that have anti-inflammatory effects, including enhancing nitric oxide production for blood flow.","1/2 cup dry (≈1 cup cooked) daily or at least 3x/week (e.g., oatmeal or overnight oats)","Prebiotic (fiber, β-glucan)"
Olive Oil (Extra Virgin),"EVOO is a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet, strongly associated with better cognitive function and lower dementia risk. It contains polyphenols (oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol) that beneficially modulate gut microbiota and reduce gut inflammation. These polyphenols and MUFAs improve synaptic function and reduce beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain (shown in animal models). EVOO consumption leads to higher levels of brain-supportive gut metabolites and improved neurovascular health.","One of the most heart-healthy fats: EVOO consistently shows reductions in heart attack and stroke risk in human trials (PREDIMED trial: high-EVOO diet lowered CVD by ~30%). Lowers inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) and improves endothelial function. The high monounsaturated fat content favorably affects lipid profiles (can raise HDL). Also beneficial for blood pressure when replacing butter. Antioxidants in olive oil protect LDL from oxidation. Use cold or moderate heat to preserve polyphenols.",2–4 Tbsp per day (as main cooking oil and dressing),Prebiotic (polyphenols)
Onions,"Onions are rich in fructooligosaccharides (FOS) which are classic prebiotic fibers. Regular onion intake increases beneficial gut flora and the production of SCFAs that can reduce neuroinflammation. Onions also contain quercetin, an antioxidant flavonoid that has been shown to improve memory in animal studies by mitigating oxidative stress. Including onions in the diet is associated with lower rates of stomach cancer and possibly better cognitive resilience (though hard to isolate, as they’re usually part of a veggie-rich diet).","Onions have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects (thanks to quercetin). They can help lower blood sugar – studies indicate improved insulin sensitivity with onion extract. Also associated with improved bone density in peri-menopausal women (likely via onion’s GPCS compound slowing bone loss). They provide chromium, which helps with glucose metabolism. Onions also have cardiovascular benefits: their sulfur compounds can prevent platelet aggregation and improve cholesterol profiles modestly. Best consumed raw or lightly cooked to preserve FOS and flavonoids.",Include ~½ onion (½ cup) most days if possible (raw or cooked),Prebiotic (fiber+fructans)
Orange,"Oranges offer fiber (especially in the pulp) and a high dose of vitamin C and hesperidin, a flavonoid. The fiber acts as a prebiotic to some extent, and hesperidin has been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults by enhancing cerebral blood flow. One study found 8-week intake of orange juice improved global cognitive function in the elderly, attributed to polyphenols. Whole oranges are preferable to juice, as the fiber reduces sugar spikes and feeds gut microbes.","Citrus flavonoids in oranges improve endothelial function and lower blood pressure. Regular orange intake is associated with lower stroke risk (vitamin C and potassium contribute to this). Oranges also boost immune function and skin health. They contain folate for heart and brain health. In studies, 100% orange juice consumption did not adversely affect weight and provided improved diet quality. However, due to sugar, whole fruit or limited juice (4–6 oz) is recommended.",1 medium orange or 6–8 oz 100% juice daily (whole fruit gives more benefits due to fiber),Prebiotic (fiber+polyphenols)
Paprika,"Paprika (made from dried peppers) contains capsaicin (if hot variety) and carotenoids like beta-carotene and lutein. While used in small quantities, these compounds can modulate gut bacteria and reduce intestinal inflammation. Lutein from paprika may accumulate in the brain (notably, high brain lutein is associated with better cognition in older adults). Paprika also provides a small amount of fiber and a lot of flavor, which can indirectly benefit health by making healthy foods more palatable.","Rich in antioxidants: especially vitamin A (as carotenoids) and vitamin E. Paprika has anti-inflammatory properties and can help improve circulation (especially the hot kind with capsaicin). It also contains iron. By using paprika and other spices, one can reduce the need for salt, thus aiding blood pressure control. The carotenoids support eye health and might reduce risk of macular degeneration. Overall, a healthful spice to include regularly.","Use liberally in cooking in place of excess salt; aim for ≥½ tsp most days (sweet or smoked for flavor, hot for capsaicin)",Prebiotic (polyphenols)
Parmesan Cheese,"Aged hard cheese, very low in lactose and rich in umami glutamates. Parmesan’s long fermentation (12+ months) produces bioactive peptides that may have hypotensive effects. Not directly tied to cognitive improvements, but in small amounts can enhance diet enjoyment without large metabolic harm (due to strong flavor, you use less). The protein content (all 9 amino acids) supports neurotransmitters. But as with all high-sat-fat cheeses, moderation is critical for vascular health which in turn affects the brain.","Parmesan is extremely high in calcium and phosphorus, supporting bone strength. Its protein is highly bioavailable. Contains casein phosphopeptides that enhance mineral absorption (good for teeth). Some studies note that despite being high in salt, hard cheese consumption didn’t raise blood pressure as much as expected, possibly due to those biopeptides. Also provides vitamin B12 and selenium. A little can go a long way in flavor, helping people stick to healthier diets by not feeling deprived.",Grate 1–2 tbsp (5–10g) as needed for flavor instead of salt (several times/week),Postbiotic (fermented dairy)
Passion Fruit,"Passion fruit is high in soluble fiber (the seedy pulp) and contains unique polyphenols and carotenoids. Its fiber supports gut bacteria and the fruit’s calming alkaloids have been traditionally used to reduce anxiety (indicating possible GABA modulation). While specific cognitive studies are lacking, the fruit’s high antioxidant content can protect the brain from oxidative stress.","The seeds are rich in Piceatannol, an antioxidant linked to improved insulin sensitivity and skin health. Passion fruit intake has shown improvements in asthma symptoms (probably due to anti-inflammatory flavonoids in the purple variety). High vitamin C boosts immunity and collagen for vessels. Some evidence suggests passion fruit peel extract reduces blood pressure and improves joint mobility in osteoarthritis. Eating the whole pulp (with seeds) yields cardiovascular benefits from fiber and potassium.",1–2 fruits (or 1/2 cup pulp) a few times per week (eat seeds and pulp together),Prebiotic (fiber+polyphenols)
Peanuts,"Though technically legumes, peanuts are consumed as nuts and have similar benefits. They contain fiber and polyphenols (particularly in the skin) that feed beneficial gut microbes. A large study showed higher peanut intake was associated with better cognitive scores in older adults, likely because of niacin and vitamin E content. Peanuts’ resveratrol (small amount) and coumaric acid also contribute to neuroprotection.","Regular peanut consumption (including peanut butter) is linked to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease due to improvements in lipid profiles and anti-inflammatory effects. Rich in arginine, peanuts promote blood flow. They also provide Coenzyme Q10 and biotin. While salted peanuts can add sodium, unsalted or lightly salted is preferable. Peanuts are calorically dense but have been associated with better weight control when eaten as snacks (due to satiety). They do not raise blood sugar (low-carb).","~1 oz (handful or 2 Tbsp peanut butter) most days (preferably unsalted, natural)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Pecans,"Pecans have one of the highest antioxidant capacities among nuts (rich in polyphenols, especially tannins). They provide fiber to support gut microbes. In a clinical trial, a pecan-rich diet improved spatial memory in older adults and reduced oxidative stress markers. Pecans’ vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol) and flavonoids likely help protect neurons from damage.","Pecans significantly lower LDL cholesterol (in one study ~10% drop with 20% of calories from pecans). They improve insulin sensitivity in overweight individuals, possibly due to bioactive compounds. Anti-inflammatory effects noted by reduced CRP and oxidized LDL after pecan consumption. However, they are high-calorie, so portion control is needed. The healthy fats (mostly monounsaturated) support heart health similarly to other nuts.",~1 oz (15–20 halves) 4–5 times per week,Prebiotic (fiber)
Peony Oil,"Peony seed oil is not common, but it contains polyunsaturated fats (linoleic acid) and some unique components (like paeonol maybe in trace). No direct studies on cognition. It might have some antioxidant compounds from peony seeds, but likely used for skin or TCM. If cold-pressed, could have minor polyphenols. Not a known pre/probiotic.","In traditional Chinese medicine, peony extracts are anti-inflammatory. The oil itself could potentially help with skin conditions (like GLA in borage oil does). Nutritionally, it would be similar to other PUFA-rich oils (like sunflower) so it could help lower LDL if used instead of butter. Without more data, consider it a neutral cooking oil with possible subtle benefits from any residual botanicals.",Use sparingly as finishing oil or supplement (insufficient data; likely similar use as other seed oils),N/A (polyunsaturated oil)
Pinto Beans,Pinto beans are a staple legume high in fiber (especially raffinose family oligosaccharides) – potent prebiotics that increase gas but also feed Bifidobacteria. They also contain polyphenols (colored varieties have more). Including pinto beans in meals improves overall diet glycemic load and has been tied to better cognitive function in diabetics (owing to improved glucose control). Folate in pintos lowers homocysteine which benefits cognition.,"Pinto beans significantly improve metabolic parameters: they can lower LDL and blood pressure. A classic study (DASH diet) included beans to successfully reduce hypertension. Pintos are rich in magnesium and potassium, aiding vascular health. They also help maintain a healthy weight through high fiber/protein content. A traditional food in Americas, they have kept generations heart-healthy when consumed as part of a plant-forward diet. The only downside is potential gas, which can be mitigated by proper soaking/cooking or consuming regularly so gut adapts.",≥3 servings per week (1/2 cup cooked per serving),Prebiotic (fiber)
Pistachios,"Pistachios are unique among nuts for their content of prebiotic fibers and phytochemicals like lutein and polyphenols. A randomized trial showed that a daily pistachio snack increased beneficial gut bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia) more than almonds, indicating strong prebiotic effect. Improvements in some cognitive domains (like processing speed) have been noted with mixed-nut diets that include pistachios, possibly due to their high levels of vitamin B6 (cofactor in neurotransmitter synthesis).","Pistachios help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. They have been shown to raise HDL and lower triglycerides when eaten regularly. Despite being ~45% fat, their impact on weight is neutral or beneficial because they increase satiety and some fat is not absorbed. Rich in potassium, they can help lower blood pressure. Also notable for containing melatonin, which might improve sleep quality. Their green color signifies lutein and zeaxanthin, supporting eye (and possibly cognitive) health.",1–2 oz (handful ~49 kernels per oz) 3–4x/week,Prebiotic (fiber)
Plums (Fresh),Fresh plums provide soluble fiber (including pectin) and polyphenols (especially in the skin) that serve as food for gut microbes. They have a moderate glycemic load and can support steady cognitive energy. Some observational data suggests that higher intake of antioxidant-rich fruits like plums is associated with slower brain aging. The anthocyanins in red/purple plums and chlorogenic acids in yellow plums help reduce neuroinflammation.,"Plums improve digestion (mild laxative effect even fresh, due to sorbitol and fiber). Rich in vitamin C and K. They have been shown to modestly reduce blood sugar and triglycerides when eaten before a meal (delaying gastric emptying via fiber). Regular consumption of plums or prunes is linked to improved bone density in postmenopausal women (possibly by reducing inflammation and providing boron). Fresh plums are hydrating and low-calorie, making them a healthy sweet snack that contributes to heart health.",2–3 plums (or ~1 cup cut) per week in season (or equivalent prunes spread out),Prebiotic (fiber)
Polenta (cooked),"Polenta is a porridge from cornmeal. If made from whole-grain cornmeal, it retains fiber that feeds gut bacteria. Traditional polenta often firms up and when cooled, forms resistant starch which acts as a prebiotic as well. This can benefit gut health and by extension, metabolic and cognitive health (via SCFA production). While polenta itself isn’t uniquely brain-boosting, using whole grain and minimal cheese makes it a neutral or positive part of a brain-healthy diet.","Polenta (whole-grain) provides steady carbs and is generally low in fat. Cooled and reheated polenta has more resistant starch, which can lower the insulin response. It’s gluten-free and gentle on the stomach. Corn’s lutein may help with eye health. Typically served with antioxidant-rich tomato sauce or vegetables in Italy, which adds to its healthfulness. It’s a better choice than refined pasta for those needing gluten-free options. Instant polenta may be more processed, so stone-ground is preferable.",1/2 cup cooked (as a side or base) a few times per week (ensure whole-grain corn),Prebiotic (if whole-grain)
Pomegranate Seed Oil,"Pomegranate seed oil contains punicic acid (an omega-5 conjugated fatty acid) which has anti-inflammatory properties. Not a traditional prebiotic or probiotic, but some of its components could influence gut flora (punicic acid can be metabolized by gut microbes into CLA). Limited data on cognition – however, pomegranate extracts (juice or supplements) have shown improved memory in middle-aged and older adults by reducing oxidative stress. The oil itself would mainly contribute via anti-inflammatory effects.","Pomegranate seed oil has been found to improve skin health and reduce inflammation in studies of eczema. It may help lower triglycerides and improve insulin sensitivity (evidence mostly in animal models and small human studies). Contains phytosterols supporting heart health. As an oil, it’s calorie-dense, so best used as a supplement or part of dressings rather than frying. The whole pomegranate fruit or juice has clearer heart benefits (improving blood flow, reducing atherosclerotic plaque). The oil is a concentrated way to get unique fatty acids from pomegranate.",1–2 tsp daily (often in capsules ~500mg punicic acid) or mixed into dressings (uncooked),N/A (bioactive oil)
Pork,"Lean pork (like tenderloin) provides high-quality protein and nutrients like thiamin, which is crucial for glucose metabolism in the brain. On the downside, red meat (including pork) can lead to production of TMAO via gut microbes, a compound linked to cognitive decline in high amounts. Thus, while occasional lean pork can fit in a balanced diet, high consumption is not advised for optimal brain health. Choose lean, unprocessed pork to minimize saturated fat and nitrates.","Pork is rich in iron and zinc (for cognitive development) and B-vitamins (especially B1, B3, B6). Lean pork in moderation can improve muscle mass maintenance. However, diets high in red/processed meats are linked to higher cardiovascular risk; substituting other proteins (fish, poultry, legumes) is associated with heart and longevity benefits. If consuming, opt for grilled or roasted lean cuts and avoid processed forms (bacon, sausage) that carry added salt and preservatives which are harmful.","≤1 serving per week of lean pork (3–4 oz), or occasionally in place of other red meats",N/A (protein source)
Provolone Cheese,"Provolone is an aged pulled-curd cheese (like a firmer mozzarella) made with bacterial cultures. It undergoes fermentation, so it contains some peptides and minimal live bacteria by the time of consumption. Not known for cognitive benefits – consider it similar to other semi-hard cheeses: enjoy for flavor in moderation. Its contribution of protein and calcium is positive, but saturated fat and salt mean high intakes could negatively impact vascular health.","Provolone adds flavor and calcium. It provides vitamin A and B12. Because it’s flavorful, a small amount can suffice in a dish (thus limiting calorie and fat intake). Like other cheeses, some evidence suggests that fermented dairy might have a neutral or slightly positive effect on cardiovascular risk compared to non-fermented dairy, possibly due to the actions of fermentation-derived compounds. Regardless, it should be treated as a treat or condiment in a health-conscious diet.",≤1–2 oz per week (a slice now and then for flavor),Postbiotic (fermented dairy)
Prunes,"Prunes are famous for their laxative effect due to high sorbitol and fiber, which indeed feeds gut bacteria and improves bowel regularity. By promoting a healthy gut environment, prunes can indirectly support cognitive health (constipation and poor gut health have been associated with poorer mood/cognition). Prune antioxidants (phenolics) also have been shown to reduce brain inflammation in aging rats and improve memory.","Proven bone health benefits: prunes can actually reverse bone loss in postmenopausal women (rich in vitamin K, boron, and polyphenols that suppress bone breakdown). They significantly increase antioxidant capacity in blood and reduce inflammation. Prunes also lower LDL oxidation, a factor in atherosclerosis. For heart health, they help with satiety (aiding weight control) and provide potassium for blood pressure regulation. Given their natural sweetness, they are a healthier alternative to sugary snacks, though portion control is important for calorie reasons.",2–3 prunes per day (around 1/4 cup) or as needed for regularity (can be daily),Prebiotic (fiber+sorbitol)
Pumpkin (Winter Squash),"Pumpkin and winter squashes are high in soluble fiber and carotenoids. The fiber supports gut bacteria and yields SCFAs. Carotenoids (beta-carotene) from pumpkin are associated with cognitive benefits – for instance, higher beta-carotene levels relate to better memory scores in aging. Pumpkin’s low glycemic load and nutrient density make it a brain-friendly carb source.",Very high in vitamin A (beta-carotene) supporting vision and immune function. Also provides potassium and vitamin C. Pumpkin has been shown to lower blood glucose in diabetic animal models and is considered a smart carb choice for humans (especially without added sugar). Its antioxidants help reduce oxidative stress. Canned pumpkin (100% pumpkin) retains these benefits and is easy to use year-round – great for heart-healthy baking or soups. The bright orange color indicates a high antioxidant capacity.,"1/2 cup cooked most days in season (e.g., as side or soup); aim for ≥2x/week when available",Prebiotic (fiber)
Pumpkin Seeds(Pepitas),"Pumpkin seeds are fiber-rich and contain tryptophan, an amino acid that the gut can convert to serotonin – known to influence mood and possibly cognitive function. Their fiber feeds gut bacteria, and the magnesium within is crucial for learning and memory. Some studies on magnesium supplementation (pumpkin seeds being an excellent natural source) show improved brain plasticity.","One of the best dietary sources of magnesium and zinc – critical for heart rhythm, immune health, and testosterone levels. Regular consumption can help lower blood pressure (magnesium, potassium) and improve glycemic control. The omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids in pepitas, along with phytosterols, contribute to lower LDL cholesterol. Also contain anti-parasitic compounds and have traditionally been used to support prostate health. Lightly roasting enhances flavor while retaining most nutrients.","1–2 tablespoons (0.5–1 oz) daily or at least 4x/week (e.g., as salad topper or snack)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Purple Corn,"Purple corn is exceptionally high in anthocyanins (even more than blueberries by weight) and has fiber, making it a potent prebiotic food. Animal studies using purple corn extract showed improved cognitive function and reduced neuroinflammation due to these anthocyanins. Consuming products made with purple corn (like pito in Andes or purple corn tortillas) would give similar gut-brain benefits as other anthocyanin foods – improved vascular health and antioxidant support in the brain.","Purple corn anthocyanins have demonstrated strong anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects in rodent studies (reducing body fat and improving insulin sensitivity). Human relevant data: a purple corn drink lowered inflammation markers in a small trial. It’s also being researched for anti-cancer properties (e.g., colon cancer cells). Nutritionally, it’s a whole grain, so it contributes to heart health and digestive health like other whole grains, with the added benefit of deep pigment antioxidants.","Incorporate into diet when available (e.g., purple corn flour or chips made with it) in place of refined corn; aim for 1–2 servings/week for variety",Prebiotic (fiber+anthocyanins)
Quinoa,"Quinoa is a pseudo-grain (seed) high in protein, fiber, and polyphenols. It serves as a prebiotic in the gut – one study showed quinoa increased beneficial gut bacteria and SCFA production when used to replace other grains. Its low glycemic and high nutrient profile support cognitive health by providing steady energy and micronutrients (iron, zinc) essential for brain function. Research in aged mice indicated quinoa intake improved memory and anxiety levels, likely via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways.","Quinoa is gluten-free and has a complete amino acid profile, making it great for heart health (helps maintain muscle and metabolism). It’s been found to lower triglycerides and LDL in human trials when it replaces refined carbs, partly due to its fiber and saponins. Also rich in magnesium (helps blood pressure) and quercetin and kaempferol (flavonoids that combat inflammation). Quinoa’s higher satiety can aid weight management. It cooks quickly and can be used in place of rice for more nutritional punch.",≥3 servings per week (½ cup cooked per serving) instead of refined grains,Prebiotic (fiber)
Quinoa Pasta,"Pasta made from quinoa flour inherits quinoa’s nutritional benefits – including more fiber and protein than typical pasta. It retains prebiotic fibers and amino acids that benefit gut health. People who eat quinoa pasta in place of refined wheat get a lower glycemic load meal, which means more stable cognitive performance post-meal (no heavy spike-crash). Combined with other Mediterranean ingredients, it can be part of a brain-healthy meal.","Quinoa pasta is often blended with other grains, but if high in quinoa content, it offers better nutrient density. It helps with blood sugar control compared to regular pasta and contributes essential minerals (iron, magnesium). Also usually gluten-free. Its higher protein content supports muscle maintenance. One could see slight improvements in cholesterol with quinoa products as shown in studies where quinoa reduced LDL. Just be mindful of portion, as calorie-wise it’s similar to other pastas.",Use in rotation with other whole-grain pastas; 1–2 servings per week as desired,Prebiotic (fiber)
Raisins,"Raisins (dried grapes) contain fiber and fructans that have mild prebiotic effects, and they are rich in boron – a trace mineral that has been linked to improved cognitive performance (boron deprivation worsens brain function in studies). Raisins also contain polyphenols from grape skins. Some research suggests that swapping refined snacks for raisins can improve memory in children due to stabilized blood sugar and micronutrients.","Raisins are dense in natural sugars but also supply potassium, iron, and antioxidants. They have a moderate glycemic index and, interestingly, have been shown to lower blood pressure in people with mild hypertension when eaten as an alternative snack (likely due to potassium and fiber). Raisins contribute to dental cavities if oral hygiene is poor, but otherwise they’re a convenient way to get nutrients. They can help relieve constipation (the fiber + tartaric acid). Overall, a small amount of raisins can fit into a heart-healthy diet, providing quick energy and nutrients.",A small handful (2 Tbsp ~ 30g) as a snack or in recipes; most days if desired instead of candy,Prebiotic (fiber)
Raspberries,"Raspberries are extremely high in fiber (one of the highest fiber fruits) which feeds gut microbes and yields butyrate beneficial for brain health. They also contain ellagitannins which gut bacteria convert to urolithin – a compound shown to improve mitochondrial function in brain cells. Population studies note that higher berry intake (including raspberries) is linked with a slower rate of cognitive decline, thanks to these fibers and flavonoids.","Raspberries improve metabolic profiles – their high fiber and polyphenol content help blunt blood sugar spikes (even adding raspberries to a high-carb meal lowers postprandial glucose). They are rich in vitamin C and manganese, supporting collagen formation and metabolism. Animal studies show raspberry ketones may reduce fatty liver, though in humans the effect is unclear. Overall, they have strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, contributing to cardiovascular health (lower oxidative stress, possibly improved blood pressure).","≥2 servings of berries per week (1/2 cup = 1 serving, more is fine given their benefits)",Prebiotic (fiber+ellagitannins)
Roasted Edamame,"Dry-roasted edamame retains the fiber and resistant oligosaccharides of whole soybeans, acting as a prebiotic. It’s a crunchy, high-protein snack that can replace less healthy options. The fiber and isoflavones support a healthy microbiome and potentially cognitive health (similar to other soy benefits). Some cognitive benefit might come from the genistein and daidzein isoflavones, which have been observed to improve working memory in postmenopausal women when soy is consumed regularly.","Nutrient-dense snack: high protein helps with satiety and weight management; significantly lower in carbs than pretzels or chips. Rich in iron, calcium, and potassium – good for blood pressure and anemia prevention. Soy protein can help reduce LDL cholesterol when part of a diet replacing animal proteins. Isoflavones in edamame improve endothelial function and reduce menopausal symptoms. Roasted form is convenient and shelf-stable, but watch sodium levels if salted.","1/4 cup (about 30g) as a snack, a few times a week instead of nuts (or alongside unsalted nuts)",Prebiotic (fiber+protein)
Romaine(Lettuce),"Romaine and other lettuces provide some fiber and are a source of folate. While not as nutrient-dense as kale or spinach, they still contribute to gut health by adding roughage. Folate is essential for brain health (low folate = high homocysteine which is linked to cognitive decline), and a serving of romaine provides a good amount. Salad consumption in general is associated with slower cognitive decline in cohort studies, likely because of the overall nutrient intake.","Very low calorie, making it excellent for weight management and thus indirectly protecting heart and brain. Hydrating and provides vitamins A and K. Romaine specifically has more nutrients than iceberg (like 2x folate, beta-carotene). High-fiber diets that include salads regularly are linked to lower cholesterol and better digestive regularity. While lettuce doesn’t have the unique compounds of cruciferous greens, it’s a great vehicle for other veggies and healthy fats (olive oil dressing), contributing to overall diet quality.",1–2 cups daily or as many days as possible (as salad base or in sandwiches),Prebiotic (fiber)
Romano Cheese,"Hard Italian cheese (similar to Parmesan in being aged and salty). Like other aged cheeses, it contains peptides from fermentation that could have minor health effects (e.g., ACE-inhibitory for blood pressure). Not noted for cognitive benefits, and due to salt and saturated fat, one should limit intake. However, in small amounts, adds flavor that can help one eat more vegetables (which does benefit cognition).","Romano is usually made from sheep’s milk (Pecorino Romano) which has more conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) than cow’s milk cheese. CLA has been linked to improved body composition and possibly reduced inflammation. It’s very salty, so it can replace salt in recipes (e.g., a sprinkle instead of a pinch of salt). Provides calcium, phosphorus, and protein. Some evidence suggests sheep’s milk cheeses have heart-healthy fats, but moderation still paramount. If one follows a DASH/MIND style diet, cheese is allowed <1/week, so this could be it.",≤1 oz per week (grated to flavor dishes sparingly),Postbiotic (fermented dairy)
Rosemary,"Rosemary contains rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid, compounds that have been shown to enhance cognitive performance in animal studies by promoting nerve growth factor and protecting neurons from free radicals. It’s not a fiber source per se, but these polyphenols can alter gut microbiota (antimicrobial against harmful strains, possibly promoting beneficial ones). Even the aroma of rosemary has been demonstrated to improve memory speed in humans. So culinary use of rosemary may confer small cognitive perks.","A powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory herb. Carnosic acid in rosemary helps protect the endothelium (lining of blood vessels) from oxidative stress. In traditional medicine, rosemary is used for improving circulation and digestion. Some human studies noted improved attention or mood when consuming or smelling rosemary. It may also aid liver detoxification and has antimicrobial properties that can help preserve food (and possibly reduce gut pathogen load). Use dried or fresh in cooking – it’s potent, so a little goes far.",Use fresh sprigs or 1/2–1 tsp dried in cooking several times a week (or inhale aroma occasionally for mental boost),Prebiotic (polyphenols)
Safflower Oil,"Safflower oil is high in linoleic acid (omega-6). While not directly a brain-boosting fat, moderate amounts of polyunsaturated fats are necessary for brain cell membranes. However, excessive omega-6 relative to omega-3 could promote inflammation. Some evidence suggests replacing saturated fat with high-linoleic oils like safflower improves insulin sensitivity, which could benefit cognitive health indirectly. Unrefined safflower may have some vitamin E but is rarely available; most is refined with minimal micronutrients.","In studies, high-linoleic oils lowered LDL and improved glycemic control in obese individuals (one trial: 8g safflower oil/day improved HbA1c and reduced abdominal fat in diabetic women). It’s one of the highest smoke-point oils, good for high-heat cooking, which can be beneficial to avoid toxic fumes when stir-frying. Lacks the antioxidants of EVOO, so not as heart-protective, but still better than butter for cholesterol. Should be balanced with omega-3 intake to maintain a healthy ratio. Overall neutral or mildly positive cardiovascular effects if used appropriately.",Use in moderation for high-heat cooking if needed (balance with olive oil/omega-3 sources). A few teaspoons to tablespoons per day at most.,N/A (omega-6 PUFA)
Sage,"Sage has a long history as a memory enhancer – even small doses of sage extract improved recall and mood in human studies (likely by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine). As a spice, it’s used sparingly, but its rosmarinic acid and other polyphenols can modulate gut bacteria and act anti-inflammatory. Thus, including sage in the diet might contribute to cognitive health through both direct enzyme modulation and indirect gut-mediated calming effects.","Sage exhibits anti-diabetic effects (improves insulin action) and lipid-lowering potential in animal models. It’s also antimicrobial; gargling sage tea helps sore throats (due to antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects). Contains compounds that can mimic estrogen (beneficial for menopausal symptoms). As an herb in cooking, it allows reduction of salt. One caution: very high amounts (supplements) can cause toxicity (thujone), but culinary use is safe. Overall, a brain-healthy herb that also aids digestion.","Use fresh/dried in cooking regularly (e.g., a pinch to 1 tsp in dishes several times a week). Also sage tea occasionally.",Prebiotic (polyphenols)
Salmon,"Salmon is an oily fish extremely rich in DHA and EPA, which are crucial for brain structure and function. Countless studies link higher fish intake (especially salmon) with better cognitive performance and slower cognitive decline. Omega-3s promote anti-inflammatory gut bacteria and improve the integrity of the gut lining. Salmon’s astaxanthin (which gives pink color) is a potent antioxidant that crosses the blood-brain barrier and may protect the brain.","Among the best foods for heart health: regular salmon intake (1–2x/week) is associated with ~30–40% reduction in fatal heart attacks. It lowers triglycerides and can raise HDL. Provides vitamin D and selenium, which support immunity and thyroid function. Also an excellent source of high-quality protein for muscle maintenance. Consuming salmon in place of red meat or processed meat yields significant improvements in inflammatory markers and arterial function. Wild-caught is optimal (higher micronutrients, lower PCB); farmed still has lots of omega-3 but more fat overall.",2 servings per week (3–4 oz each) as recommended by American Heart Association (more if replacing all red meat),N/A (omega-3 source)
Sardines,"Sardines are rich in omega-3s and often consumed with bones (calcium). Some traditional sardine preparations are fermented (like pickling) which could add probiotic benefit, but most canned sardines are just preserved in oil or water (no live cultures). Regardless, their omega-3 content supports brain health similarly to salmon. They also contain coenzyme Q10 and vitamin D. Frequent sardine intake has been linked anecdotally to sharp cognitive aging (ex: populations in Spain with high sardine consumption do well), likely via cardiovascular protection.","Being a small fish, sardines are very low in mercury yet high in omega-3. They improve cholesterol profiles (raise HDL) and provide a significant amount of calcium, vitamin D, and B12 – a combination great for bones, nerves, and blood. Sardines also supply taurine, which may help lower blood pressure and improve cardiac function. Canned sardines can be high in sodium, so choosing no-salt-added or rinsing can help. Overall, they rank as one of the most nutritious, economical fish to reduce heart disease risk and improve nutrient status.","1–2 cans per week (each ~3.75 oz, often 1 can = 1 serving) in place of processed meats or luncheon meats for brain-heart benefits",Probiotic (fermented/canned)
Sauerkraut,May support brain health,"Antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects, gut-brain axis support",100g/week,Prebiotic/Probiotic
Sea Bass,"Sea bass is a moderately fatty fish depending on species (Chilean sea bass is high fat but also high in pollutants; black sea bass is leaner). Generally, sea bass provides some omega-3 but not as much as salmon/sardine. It is a good protein source for those who prefer milder fish. Including sea bass as part of seafood intake is beneficial for cognitive health largely because it can displace red meat and provide some omega-3. However, large species (like Patagonian toothfish sold as Chilean sea bass) have mercury and one should limit intake.","Sea bass offers selenium and magnesium. If eating Chilean sea bass, note it’s very high in omega-3 (almost like salmon) but also one of the highest in mercury; thus, small portions infrequently. Black sea bass (Atlantic) is lean with about 0.5g omega-3 per 4 oz and lower contaminants. Both are good for heart health if not fried or butter-drenched, as part of a varied fish diet. They provide high-quality protein and nutrient density with low saturated fat.",1 serving per week (max for large sea bass due to mercury; smaller species can be 1–2/week),N/A (lean protein)
Seaweed,"Edible seaweeds (kelp, nori, dulse, etc.) are packed with unique fibers (alginate, agar, carrageenan) that are highly fermentable by gut bacteria, fostering beneficial strains in the colon. Japanese diets rich in seaweed are correlated with lower rates of dementia (though many factors at play). Seaweed also provides marine minerals like iodine (critical for thyroid, which affects brain development) and some have neuroprotective compounds (fucoidan in brown seaweed showed memory benefits in mice by reducing inflammation).","Seaweed intake is associated with metabolic benefits: it can reduce post-meal blood sugar (the fiber blocks carb absorption) and aid in weight control by promoting satiety and fat excretion. The iodine and tyrosine support healthy thyroid function, preventing hypothyroidism (which can cause cognitive sluggishness). Also supplies iron, calcium, magnesium, and trace elements like vanadium (may help with glucose metabolism). However, some seaweeds have very high iodine or sodium, so variety and moderation are key (especially for kelp).","Small amounts daily or often (e.g., a nori sheet or 1–2 tbsp dried kelp flakes), or seaweed salad 1–2x/week (watch iodine intake not to consistently exceed RDA)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Seaweed Snacks,"Commercial seaweed snacks (usually nori sheets roasted with oil and salt) provide the prebiotic fibers and minerals of seaweed in a convenient form. They can contribute to gut health similarly, though often they are lightly seasoned. Great as a low-calorie, fiber-rich snack instead of chips. Cognitive benefit comes from the same iodine (for thyroid) and possibly from the snack replacing less healthy foods. Some brands also include sesame oil or wasabi, adding antioxidants.","These snacks are typically low in calories but can be high in sodium (check labels). They provide some vitamin B12 if the seaweed is the right kind (certain red seaweeds). Good source of iodine – a few sheets can meet the daily requirement, which is beneficial for those not consuming dairy/iodized salt (but again, caution not to overdo daily). The nori is rich in taurine and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, a marine omega-3, albeit small amounts) which support heart health. Overall, a heart-healthy alternative to potato chips that gives a nutrient boost.",1 pack (about 5g) as a snack a few times per week (or daily if low-sodium variety and mindful of iodine content),Prebiotic (fiber)
Semolina Pasta,"Semolina is the refined durum wheat flour typically used in pasta. It has been stripped of most fiber and thus offers little prebiotic benefit. As a refined carb, excessive intake can lead to blood sugar spikes, which are not ideal for brain health. However, in the context of a balanced diet with fiber from other sources and portion control, semolina pasta can be an energy source – preferably al dente (which lowers glycemic index). Not beneficial to microbiome, but small portions won’t harm if fiber comes from veggies in the meal.","Provides quickly accessible carbohydrates for energy. Enriched semolina is fortified with B-vitamins (including folic acid) and iron, which have helped reduce neural tube defects and anemia in populations. But compared to whole grain, it lacks many nutrients. On the plus side, durum wheat protein (gluten) and resistant starch when pasta is cooled can have some metabolic benefit. For heart health, whole-grain pasta is superior; refined pasta should be limited especially for those with insulin resistance. If consumed, pairing with healthy fats and veggies (as in Mediterranean style) mitigates impact.","Limit to 2–3 servings per week, and keep portions moderate (1 cup cooked) or opt for whole-grain versions most of the time",N/A (refined grain)
Sesame Oil,"Sesame oil contains sesamol and sesamin – antioxidants that may protect neurons (sesamol has shown neuroprotective effects in ischemia models). It’s not a prebiotic, but these lignans can influence gut microbiota composition by acting as antioxidants and possibly mild phytoestrogens. Sesame oil is often used in small amounts for flavor; any cognitive benefit would be indirect via improved cardiovascular health from unsaturated fats and antioxidants.","Sesame oil, especially unrefined (dark) from roasted seeds, is rich in antioxidants which help reduce blood pressure and increase HDL (observed in some studies where hypertensive patients got sesame oil). It’s stable against oxidation due to sesamol, making it relatively healthy for cooking. Contains vitamin E and polyunsaturated fats that improve lipid profiles. Also has anti-inflammatory effects (sesamin can inhibit the delta-5-desaturase enzyme, potentially anti-atherogenic). Use in moderation due to high omega-6 content; balancing with omega-3 intake is wise.","1–2 tsp per day in cooking or dressings, especially in Asian dishes (strong flavor helps use less)",N/A (bioactive oil)
Sesame Seeds,"Sesame seeds offer fiber and lignans (sesamin, sesamolin) that act as prebiotics/antioxidants. They aren’t typically eaten in huge quantities, but even small amounts (as on bread or in tahini) contribute fiber and help feed gut bacteria. Some research shows cognitive improvement in mice supplemented with sesame lignans (due to anti-inflammatory effects). In humans, one study found better recall in older folks with higher sesame intake (likely via cardiovascular improvements).","Sesame seeds can help lower cholesterol – sesamin and phytosterols in them reduce cholesterol absorption. They are high in calcium, magnesium, and zinc (good for bone and immune health). Regular intake (e.g., tahini as part of hummus) has been associated with improved markers in arthritic patients (due to anti-inflammatory properties). Also beneficial for hair/skin (rich in nutrients and oils). Because they’re tiny, they’re often not chewed thoroughly – grinding them (tahini) makes nutrients more bioavailable. Watch portion if weight is a concern; they are calorie-dense.","1–2 Tbsp tahini or seeds most days (for example, as part of hummus or sprinkled on salads)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Sourdough Pasta,"Sourdough fermentation isn’t only for bread – some artisanal pastas ferment the dough before drying. This can create postbiotic compounds and lower the glycemic index. If truly sourdough-fermented, the pasta may have enhanced nutrient availability and be easier to digest (gluten partially broken down, and some prebiotic fructans created). For cognition, the benefit is mainly a more favorable blood sugar response and possibly better gut tolerance, both of which support brain function.","Sourdough fermentation increases organic acids (like lactic acid) which help with mineral absorption (iron, zinc). It also can reduce FODMAP content in wheat, making it more gut-friendly for those with IBS. A lower GI means less insulin spike, beneficial for metabolic health. Some studies show that sourdough bread leads to improved postprandial glucose and insulin profiles compared to regular bread – likely similar for pasta if fermented. Overall, a slight edge over regular pasta in terms of health, but still should ideally be whole grain sourdough for maximum benefit.","Use in place of regular pasta when available. (If not whole grain, treat as refined but slightly better – so moderate portions, e.g., 1 cup cooked)",Postbiotic (fermented grain)
Soy Milk(Fortified),"Plain soy milk contains some of soy’s soluble fiber and oligosaccharides (stachyose, raffinose) that are prebiotic – fostering bifidobacteria in the colon (some soy milks might remove these to reduce gas). It also contains isoflavones that can benefit cognition in postmenopausal women (shown to improve executive function in some trials). Usually sold fortified with calcium, B12, etc., making it nutritionally comparable to dairy. Some soy milks are cultured with probiotics for flavor – those would have probiotic benefit too.","Soy milk, as part of a diet replacing animal fats, helps lower LDL cholesterol. It’s lactose-free and generally heart-healthy (low saturated fat). The isoflavones have mild estrogenic effects that can improve arterial elasticity and potentially bone health. Fortified soy milk provides calcium and vitamin D like cow’s milk, supporting bones and blood pressure regulation. It’s also been associated with reduced prostate cancer risk in men (due to isoflavones). Just be mindful to choose unsweetened versions to avoid added sugars that detract from benefits.","1 cup per day (in cereal, smoothies, etc.) as a dairy alternative (ensure it’s calcium-fortified)",Prebiotic (some fiber) & Probiotic (if cultured)
Soybean Oil,"Soybean oil is high in omega-6 linoleic acid and is widely used in processed foods. Alone it’s not a cognitive enhancer and excessive consumption (with low omega-3) can skew the omega-6/3 balance possibly promoting inflammation. However, soybean oil also contains a small amount of alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) and vitamin E. Replacing saturated fat with soybean oil lowers LDL, indirectly benefiting brain vascular health. New studies in mice have raised questions about high soybean oil diets affecting hypothalamic gene expression (energy metabolism and maybe neuroinflammation), but human relevance is unclear.","It’s cheap and has helped reduce transfat use, which is a positive (most soybean oil is now non-hydrogenated). Lowers cholesterol when replacing butter/lard in diet. But it is prone to oxidation at high heat (unless high-oleic modified). Contains plant sterols naturally, which help reduce cholesterol absorption. Some concern: very high intake might contribute to inflammation if not balanced with omega-3 sources. Overall, okay in moderation, but for heart health one might prefer oils with more MUFA/omega-3 (olive, canola). If used, combining with antioxidant-rich foods/spices can mitigate oxidation.",Use sparingly – aim to get majority of fats from olive/canola/omega-3 sources. (Soy oil is fine occasionally for high-heat frying due to high smoke point),N/A (omega-6 PUFA)
Soybeans(Whole),"Whole soybeans (e.g., in soups or soy nuts) have significant fiber and oligosaccharides that feed gut microbes, as discussed with edamame and roasted edamame. Whole cooked soybeans are less common in Western diets, but in forms like okara (soy pulp) or kinako (roasted soy flour) they can contribute to fiber intake and gut health. Cognitively, soy’s isoflavones and nutrient profile (folate, iron, calcium) are beneficial as previously noted. Whole soy also offers choline. Overall similar story: good for brain via gut and vascular health.","Whole soybeans can lower cholesterol and improve blood pressure. For instance, traditional diets using whole soy (like in natto, tempeh, or cooked soybeans in stews) have lower CVD incidence. The combination of protein and fiber in soy helps with weight management and blood sugar control. They do contain some anti-nutrients (phytates), but cooking and fermentation reduce those. Soybeans also have omega-3 ALA in small amounts. Many countries’ dietary guidelines consider a serving of soy (or other legumes) daily to be part of a healthy diet.","3–4 servings per week (if not consuming other soy foods, up to 1 serving daily fine; e.g., 1/2 cup cooked beans, or equivalent tempeh/tofu)",Prebiotic (fiber) & Probiotic (if fermented)
Spelt Pasta,"Spelt is an ancient wheat variety often higher in protein and fiber than modern wheat. Pasta made from whole spelt flour contains that fiber and thus has prebiotic effects. People with mild wheat sensitivity sometimes tolerate spelt better (though it’s not gluten-free). For cognitive health, it’s essentially a whole grain – offering steady carbs, B-vitamins, and fiber for gut health, thereby beneficial as part of a brain-supportive diet.","Whole spelt has a slightly lower glycemic index than white wheat pasta and retains more minerals (like zinc and magnesium). It can contribute to better blood sugar control and satiety. Spelt’s higher protein content might help with muscle maintenance. Some studies show ancient grains like spelt can reduce inflammatory markers more than modern refined grains, possibly due to different antioxidant profiles. Overall, treat spelt pasta as one would treat whole-wheat pasta: a healthier carb choice that supports heart and metabolic health when eaten in appropriate portions.",Use as an alternative to whole wheat pasta; 1–2 servings per week (or more if rotating various whole grains),Prebiotic (fiber)
Spinach,"Spinach is rich in fiber and also nitrates (like beet) and lutein. It’s one of the star brain foods: studies show that one serving of leafy greens like spinach per day is associated with markedly slower cognitive decline. Its prebiotic fibers (like raffinose) feed gut microbes, and its antioxidants protect the brain. Spinach also provides iron (for oxygen transport) and folate (for neurotransmitter synthesis).","Spinach improves vascular health via nitrates (helping blood pressure). It’s loaded with vitamin K which along with calcium and magnesium in spinach contributes to bone health and possibly arterial health. The carotenoids (lutein and beta-carotene) reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. Regular spinach consumption is linked to lower risk of macular degeneration and might improve exercise efficiency (due to nitrates). It’s also very low calorie, aiding weight control. Cooking it increases the bioavailability of certain nutrients (like vitamin A), but raw gives more vitamin C – variety is fine.",≥6 servings of leafy greens/week (1 cup raw or 1/2 cup cooked = 1 serving; daily use ideal),Prebiotic (fiber)
Spinach Pasta,"Typically, “spinach pasta” is regular semolina pasta with spinach powder added for color/nutrients. The amount of spinach is usually small, so the added fiber is minor and the microbiome benefit over normal pasta is minimal. However, it does contribute a bit of vitamin A and lutein. Unless the pasta is also whole grain, treat it nutritionally similar to refined pasta with a veggie boost. Possibly slightly lower GI due to the tiny fiber/protein from spinach, but not significant.","Provides more vitamins (A, K) than plain pasta, but not enough to count as a serving of veg. The attractiveness of green pasta might encourage more vegetable intake with it (psychologically). No adverse effects, but one should not assume it’s as healthy as eating actual spinach. If one enjoys it, fine – just continue to include actual vegetables in the meal. If the spinach pasta is made with a blend of spinach and whole wheat, then it’s nutritionally better (more fiber). Check labels to see if fiber content is appreciably higher.","Similar to regular pasta – include occasionally but prioritize actual veggies and whole grains for fiber. If it encourages you to eat more greens, that’s a plus.",Prebiotic (some fiber)
Split Peas,"Split peas (dried peas) are legumes extremely high in soluble fiber. Split pea soup is a classic brain-healthy dish: one cup has ~16g fiber, profoundly feeding gut bacteria and yielding SCFAs that reduce systemic inflammation. Folate in split peas supports neurotransmitter production. There’s evidence that legume intake (peas, lentils, beans) is a strong predictor of longevity – likely by preventing vascular dementia through improved cardiovascular health.","Splits peas dramatically improve cholesterol – diets adding daily pea soup saw marked LDL reductions. They also help with blood sugar control (low GI, high fiber/protein). High in potassium, they assist blood pressure regulation. Provide iron and zinc for immune function. Split peas contain compounds that may have anti-cancer effects (like saponins). The only caveat is they can cause gas if one’s not used to a high fiber diet – but that’s a sign of their prebiotic action. Cooking them into soups with spices (bay leaf, cumin) can reduce gas and add benefits.","≥2–3 servings per week (1/2 cup cooked = serving, e.g., a bowl of split pea soup once a week or use as side dish)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Strawberries,"Like other berries, strawberries are rich in anthocyanins and fiber. Long-term studies (e.g., Nurses’ Health Study) found women who ate ≥2 servings of strawberries per week had a slower rate of cognitive decline by up to 2.5 years. The polyphenols in strawberries improve neuronal signaling and reduce neuroinflammation. One trial in older adults showed improved word recognition after 90 days of strawberry supplementation. Fiber aids the gut, and strawberries’ vitamin C may directly reduce brain oxidative stress.","Strawberries have been shown to lower CRP (inflammatory marker) in overweight adults, indicating anti-inflammatory power. They improve endothelial function and have modest effects on lowering blood pressure and raising antioxidant status in blood. Being low calorie and sweet, they are excellent for weight management (substitute for high-cal desserts). The combination of vitamin C and polyphenols supports immune function and skin health. Consuming them regularly is associated with lower risk of diabetes and some cancers (likely because they improve overall diet quality).",≥2 servings of berries per week (ideally more – one serving is ~1 cup or 8 medium berries),Prebiotic (fiber+polyphenols)
Sturgeon,"Sturgeon is a long-lived, large fish (often used for caviar). As such, its flesh can accumulate contaminants; it’s not commonly eaten in large amounts. Nutritionally, sturgeon meat is a good protein source and has some omega-3 (not as high as oily fish, but moderate). It’s not a usual component of diets, so no direct cognitive studies. Treat it as an occasional protein – likely fine but not special for brain health beyond the benefit of being fish.","Depending on the species, sturgeon can be fatty (Beluga) or leaner. It provides a lot of B12, selenium, and a decent amount of omega-3. However, due to its size and lifespan, mercury could be a concern. Caviar (sturgeon eggs) is high in choline and omega-3, actually quite beneficial in small amounts (aside from salt). But sturgeon is overfished and often high in contaminants, so from a health (and sustainability) standpoint, one might choose smaller, shorter-lived fish. If consumed, limit frequency and ensure source is reputable (some farmed sturgeon are available, which might have controlled diet thus less contaminant).","Rarely – perhaps a few times a year if at all, due to sustainability and possible mercury (opt for safer fish ordinarily). If you do have it, treat similarly to other fish in portion (~4 oz).",N/A (lean protein)
Sunflower Oil,"Sunflower oil is similar to safflower oil in composition – high in linoleic acid. Unrefined versions have vitamin E and polyphenols, but most use is refined and high-oleic (for frying) or standard (for dressings). Not directly helpful for microbiome or cognition except as a replacement for saturated fats. There’s some research indicating that mid-life diets very high in omega-6 and low in omega-3 might contribute to late-life cognitive decline via inflammation, so balance is key. Using sunflower oil within a Mediterranean diet (with fish and olive oil too) is fine.","Rich in vitamin E (one of the highest among oils), which is an antioxidant protecting cell membranes (heart and brain). Linoleic acid in moderate amounts can reduce LDL cholesterol and possibly improve insulin sensitivity. High-oleic sunflower oil, which is more common now, behaves like olive/canola with heat stability and health effects (good MUFA content). Standard sunflower oil has a high smoke point but also a high omega-6: too much of it could theoretically tilt the inflammation balance. Current guidelines suggest polyunsaturated fats (including omega-6) are heart-healthy when replacing saturated fats, so sunflower oil can be part of that strategy, just ensure omega-3 intake is adequate too.","Use moderately; prefer high-oleic type for cooking. Total added oils ~2–4 Tbsp/day from mixed sources (sunflower can be a part, but include omega-3 sources or olive oil as well)",N/A (omega-6 PUFA)
Sunflower Seeds,"Sunflower seeds offer fiber and are particularly high in vitamin E and selenium, antioxidants that support brain health. Their fiber and protein content help modulate blood sugar, providing steady energy to the brain. They also contain choline (modest amount) and polyphenols (chlorogenic acid) beneficial for cognition. Including sunflower seeds as part of a nut/seed mix has been associated with improved cardiovascular profiles (lower inflammation), indirectly benefiting the brain.","Excellent for heart health: sunflower seeds have been shown to lower C-reactive protein in a trial where people with diabetes ate sunflower seeds daily. Vitamin E content is huge – one serving gives about 2/3 of RDA, helping reduce oxidative stress. High in magnesium which can reduce blood pressure. Plant sterols in them help reduce cholesterol absorption. However, they are often salted – choose unsalted or lightly salted to avoid too much sodium. There is some omega-6, but also a decent amount of protein and folate. Roasting can diminish some vitamin content but increases flavor and digestibility.","1–2 Tbsp daily (e.g., sprinkled on salads/oatmeal) or a small handful 3–5x/week (opt for unsalted)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Sweet Corn,"Fresh sweet corn (on the cob or frozen) has both soluble and insoluble fiber to support gut microbes. It also provides lutein and other carotenoids similar to other yellow veggies. While often thought of as a starchy food, it’s a whole grain/vegetable hybrid that contributes to fiber intake – beneficial for cognitive health via gut-brain axis. Not a powerhouse like leafy greens, but part of a varied plant diet that correlates with better cognitive aging.","Provides folate and thiamin (B1) which are crucial for energy metabolism. The insoluble fiber aids in digestive regularity (corn often visible in stool – that’s cellulose doing its job). It has a low-to-moderate glycemic index when eaten as kernels (higher if made into corn flour). Sweet corn also contains ferulic acid, an antioxidant that, when corn is cooked, becomes more bioavailable and can contribute to reduced cholesterol and improved vascular function. Just avoid drowning it in butter and salt to keep it heart-healthy. Grilling or boiling and seasoning with herbs/lime is a great way to enjoy it.","Treat as vegetable: ½ cup = 1 serving, enjoy a few times a week in season (counts toward whole grain servings too if needed)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Sweet Potatoes,"Sweet potatoes are high in both soluble fiber (pectin) and insoluble fiber, feeding gut bacteria effectively. They also have abundant beta-carotene (especially orange varieties) which is associated with better cognitive function in aging due to antioxidant effects. Additionally, sweet potatoes (particularly purple varieties) have anthocyanins that have shown memory-enhancing effects in animal studies by reducing neuroinflammation.","Support metabolic health: despite sweetness, they have a lower glycemic index than white potatoes, especially if boiled and cooled some. Rich in potassium for blood pressure control. One study showed that replacing white potato with sweet potato lowered HbA1c in diabetics. Beta-carotene content supports immune function and vision. Purple sweet potatoes in Okinawa (a Blue Zone) are thought to contribute to the low rates of arteriosclerosis there. Even the leaves of sweet potato are edible and highly nutritious. For maximum benefit, include various colored sweet potatoes (orange, purple) and keep the skin on for extra fiber.","2–3 servings per week (1/2 cup or ~100g each), prepared by boiling/roasting (try purple variety if available)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Swiss Chard,"Swiss chard is another leafy green rich in fiber and nitrates (though less than spinach/beet). It contributes to microbiome health via fiber and provides a spectrum of phytonutrients (like syringic acid) that may help regulate blood sugar. As a leafy green, it falls under the category strongly linked to slower cognitive decline. Often overlooked, but very nutritious – supports brain by delivering magnesium (for memory) and vitamin K and lutein (like other greens).","Helps with blood sugar: chard contains an antioxidant (syringic acid) that may inhibit carbohydrate breakdown, contributing to better glycemic control. High in magnesium, which is crucial for muscle and nerve function and is often low in typical diets. Also a source of iron (especially when cooked, though non-heme). Supports bone health with vitamin K and calcium. The colorful stems have betalains (like beets) that are anti-inflammatory. Chard is a great addition to a heart-healthy diet – providing benefit similar to spinach. Just note it’s high in oxalates (like spinach), which can affect kidney stone formers if eaten in massive quantities uncooked; cooking reduces that.",≥3–4 servings per week (swap in for spinach/kale sometimes for variety),Prebiotic (fiber)
Swiss Cheese(Emmental),"Swiss-type cheese is fermented with Propionibacteria which create CO₂ (holes) and also produce vitamin B12 and propionate. There is some evidence that Emmental cheese has probiotic effects; one study found Emmental consumption changed gut microbiota favorably (possibly due to Propionibacterium freudenreichii surviving GI tract). Not a cognitive booster per se, but as a fermented cheese with possibly lower lactose, it could be more gut-friendly. Saturated fat content remains high, so excess intake could counteract benefits.","Emmental cheese is relatively rich in B12 (due to bacterial synthesis) and calcium. One slice (about 1 oz) can provide a third of daily calcium. Some research suggested that cheeses like Emmental might have ACE-inhibitory peptides that can mildly lower blood pressure. And despite being ~30% fat, moderate cheese intake hasn’t been strongly linked to higher heart risk – possibly due to calcium binding some fats and the fermentation factors. Still, moderation (as with all full-fat cheese) is key for heart health. Consider that it’s high in sodium as well, which can impact blood pressure if eaten in large amounts.","≤1–2 slices (1–2 oz) per week, as part of meals (choose it over processed cheese due to natural probiotic element)",Probiotic (fermented dairy)
Tempeh,"Tempeh is a fermented whole soybean product from Indonesia. It contains live cultures (if not cooked to death) and certainly many beneficial postbiotics (vitamin B12 can be present from fermentation, plus enzymes). Tempeh consumption provides the prebiotic fibers of soy in a more digestible form and probiotics, making it excellent for gut health. Animal studies have shown tempeh reduces pro-inflammatory gut bacteria and improves memory in aging rodents. In humans, substituting meat with tempeh can improve cognitive health indirectly through better cardiovascular profile.","Tempeh is rich in protein and contains all essential amino acids. Fermentation reduces soy’s phytic acid and increases mineral bioavailability (zinc, iron). It has been linked to improved cholesterol levels, likely due to soy protein and bioactive peptides formed during fermentation. Also high in isoflavones, supporting bone health and possibly easing menopause symptoms. Because it’s usually made with a fungus (Rhizopus) that produces enzymes, tempeh is easier to digest and might cause less bloating than unfermented soy. It’s a versatile meat substitute that, when not deep-fried, is very heart-healthy.","3–4 oz serving, 2–3 times per week (in place of red/processed meat for maximal benefit)",Probiotic (fermented soy)
Tilsit Cheese,"Tilsit (Tilsiter) is a semi-hard cheese originally from East Prussia, similar to Havarti. It’s a smear-ripened cheese (sometimes inoculated with Brevibacterium linens like Limburger). Thus, it carries some surface bacteria contributions. Again, not known for boosting cognition, but as a fermented food it offers minor probiotic/postbiotic advantages over completely unfermented cheese. Contains protein and calcium beneficial for general health, but should be moderate due to sat fat.","Tilsit has a tangy flavor which indicates presence of short-chain fatty acids from fermentation. Nutritionally, similar to other semi-hard cheeses: a good source of calcium, phosphorus, and B12. Smear bacteria might produce extra vitamin B and flavor compounds. If made from raw milk (some traditional Tilsit are), it might contain a broader range of microbes and enzymes, which some argue can support gut health (though raw dairy carries risk of pathogens). From a heart perspective, treat it like other cheeses: moderate amounts can fit in, but large amounts would add a lot of saturated fat and sodium.",≤1–2 oz per week (as with similar semi-hard cheeses),Postbiotic (fermented dairy)
Tofu,"Tofu is coagulated soy milk – not fermented (unless it’s a fermented variety like “stinky tofu”). Regular tofu doesn’t have probiotics and has very little fiber (the fiber mostly removed in making soy milk). However, it is a good plant protein that, when replacing animal protein, improves cardiovascular health. Cognitive benefit comes mainly from its isoflavones; some studies show improved memory in postmenopausal women on soy isoflavones. Also, a diet including tofu instead of red meat means lower saturated fat, supporting better brain vascular health.","Tofu is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fat, and a solid source of protein, iron, and calcium (if calcium-set). Regular consumption can lower LDL and is associated with lower risk of breast and prostate cancers (especially when started in adolescence for breast). There were old myths about tofu and cognitive impairment in some observational studies in men – likely confounded by factors like formaldehyde use in some tofu preservation historically. Overall, current consensus is tofu is beneficial as part of a healthy diet. It’s versatile – can be used in stir-fries, smoothies, etc., to boost protein without harming heart health.","3–5 oz serving, ~3–4 times per week (in place of meat or as protein in meals)","N/A (protein, minimal fiber)"
Tomatoes,"Tomatoes have some fiber (particularly in the seeds/skin) that feeds gut bacteria, but their standout nutrient is lycopene, an antioxidant associated with cognitive protection. Lycopene fights oxidative damage in the brain and is better absorbed from cooked tomatoes with oil (like pasta sauce). While not directly “probiotic,” tomatoes are often used in ferments (like salsa, ketchup originally). Higher tomato intake is linked to lower risk of neurodegenerative disease, possibly via vascular benefits (tomatoes reduce stroke risk).","Strong evidence for cardiovascular benefit: a meta-analysis found tomato intake (or lycopene supplements) modestly lowered LDL and blood pressure. Lycopene also has anti-atherosclerotic effects. Tomatoes provide vitamin C, potassium, and folate – all heart-healthy. They have a low glycemic load and fit well into weight management. Processed tomato products (sauce, paste) concentrate lycopene and have shown improvements in endothelial function. Also, a high tomato diet is associated with lower cancer risk (especially prostate). Adding a bit of olive oil when cooking increases nutrient absorption.","Aim for a serving of tomato or tomato products daily (e.g., a raw tomato, or 1/2 cup sauce) as part of meals",Prebiotic (fiber) + Postbiotic (if fermented)
Trout,"Trout (e.g., rainbow trout) is a fatty freshwater fish high in omega-3 (though a bit less than salmon). It’s an excellent brain food because of those omega-3s supporting neuronal membranes and reducing inflammation. Eating trout instead of red or processed meats has similar cognitive benefits to other oily fish. Plus, trout are often smaller and have lower mercury than big ocean fish. They provide vitamin D which is linked to better cognitive function when sufficient.","As an oily fish, trout improves heart health by lowering triglycerides and providing anti-thrombotic effects (EPA from omega-3). Farmed rainbow trout is often fed a diet to keep omega-3 high and is considered one of the safer, more sustainable farmed fish. It’s rich in protein, B vitamins (especially B12 and niacin), and selenium. These nutrients all support metabolic health and thyroid function. Trout has a delicate flavor so it can be a good “starter” fish for those who find salmon too strong, thus encouraging more fish consumption which is beneficial for population heart health outcomes.","1–2 servings per week (each ~4 oz), as part of the recommended fish intake",N/A (omega-3 source)
Turkey,"Turkey (especially breast) is a lean protein with minimal saturated fat. It’s rich in tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin and melatonin – sometimes said to help with mood and sleep (although in reality, food tryptophan’s effects are subtle). As with chicken, replacing some red meat with lean turkey can improve vascular health and thereby cognitive outcomes. No direct gut or cognitive boost aside from being a generally healthier meat choice (if not processed).","Turkey provides selenium (important for thyroid and antioxidant enzymes) and all the B vitamins including a high amount of B6 and B12, supporting brain and blood health. It’s typically lower in cholesterol per ounce than red meat. Dark meat turkey has more zinc and iron, but also a bit more fat; still generally leaner than red meats. Processed turkey (deli meat) can be high in sodium and nitrates, so fresh turkey is preferable. Good for heart health when consumed without skin and cooked healthily – helps maintain muscle mass and a high thermic effect of food (protein).","2 servings per week (3–4 oz each) in place of red or processed meats (e.g., a turkey chili or roast turkey)",N/A (lean protein)
Walnut Oil,"Walnut oil is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) and polyphenols (if unrefined). As such, it can help support a healthy omega-6:3 ratio in the diet, which may reduce neuroinflammation. It lacks the fiber of whole walnuts but retains the healthy fats. Some cognitive benefit might come from improved cardiovascular health – e.g., a study that gave walnut oil showed better endothelial function. It’s delicate and best used cold; good as part of salad dressings to increase ALA intake for those who don’t eat fish.","Walnut oil helps lower blood pressure and has anti-inflammatory effects (walnuts are known to reduce CRP – the oil likely carries some of that benefit when replacing saturated fats). It’s high in PUFA, so not great for high heat, but fine for drizzling. Walnut oil contains some vitamin K and E, and plant sterols. It can help improve lipid profiles by lowering LDL if used instead of butter or palm oil. Since it’s more expensive, people tend to use it sparingly – which is fine given you get benefits even in small doses due to omega-3 content.","1 tsp daily (mixed into food after cooking) or a few tsp per week (very flavorful, so a little goes far)",N/A (omega-3 ALA source)
Walnuts,"Walnuts are a top-tier brain food. They provide fiber and polyphenols that foster a healthy gut microbiome (walnut consumption shifts gut bacteria toward beneficial species producing anti-inflammatory metabolites). They are also one of the richest plant sources of omega-3 ALA. Human studies: in seniors, regular walnut eaters showed better memory scores and delayed cognitive decline. Walnuts’ PUFA, polyphenols (like ellagitannins, converted by gut microbes to urolithin A), and vitamin E collectively protect neurons and improve brain function.",Walnuts improve cardiovascular risk factors: they consistently lower LDL and total cholesterol and reduce blood pressure (the Walnuts and Healthy Aging trial showed endothelial function benefits even without overall cognitive change in healthy elders). They also reduce inflammation – one study found regular walnut intake lowered CRP and IL-6 in adults. Walnuts may help with weight management despite being calorie-dense; they increase satiety and some calories are lost due to poor mastication. They provide minerals like magnesium and are associated with lower incidence of type 2 diabetes when consumed regularly.,"1–2 oz (a small handful, ~14 halves per oz) daily or at least 5x/week (significant benefits seen at ~5 servings/week in studies)",Prebiotic (fiber+polyphenols+omega-3)
Wasabi (Japanese horseradish),"True wasabi contains ITCs (isothiocyanates) similar to those in cruciferous veggies, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. It’s eaten in tiny amounts as a condiment with sushi, so its impact is more sensory (clearing sinuses etc.) than nutritional. Not a prebiotic or probiotic, but it may transiently stimulate gastric secretion and possibly gut motility. No direct evidence for cognitive enhancement; any such claim would be anecdotal (like “it wakes you up” due to its intense pungency).","Potent anti-microbial: wasabi can kill H. pylori in lab studies and reduce foodborne bacteria (hence its traditional pairing with raw fish). It contains compounds that may inhibit platelet aggregation (so potentially blood-thinning in effect). Also has anti-inflammatory effects in test tubes – one compound suppressed cyclooxygenase similar to NSAIDs. But again, amounts eaten are very small. Most “wasabi” in stores is actually mustard+horseradish+green dye, which have similar though lesser ITC content. Enjoying wasabi might allow one to eat more anti-inflammatory fish (sushi) by adding flavor, indirectly benefiting health.","Use occasionally with sushi or in sauces – benefit mainly from spicing up healthy food, not to be relied on for core nutrition (very small serving)",N/A (bioactive compound)
Wheat Germ Fortified Pasta,"Pasta enriched with wheat germ aims to boost fiber, vitamin E, and folate content. Wheat germ is the nutrient-dense part of the grain that includes prebiotic fibers (arabinoxylans) and vitamin E (an antioxidant good for brain). Such pasta likely has more fiber than normal, feeding gut bacteria and leading to a lower glycemic response, beneficial for cognition. It also supplies more micronutrients supporting brain health. Data specifically on this pasta is limited, but one can extrapolate that it’s healthier than regular refined pasta.","Wheat germ is rich in vitamin E, folate, magnesium, zinc – adding it to pasta improves the overall nutritional profile. This can help with cholesterol (wheat germ oil lowers cholesterol). Additional folate helps reduce homocysteine (linked to heart disease). The extra fiber aids digestion and satiety, possibly lowering calorie intake. Essentially, wheat germ fortified pasta moves closer to whole wheat pasta benefits while maintaining a similar taste/texture to refined. Still, it contains gluten (for those sensitive). Check if the fortification adds significant fiber; if yes, that’s a heart and metabolic plus.","Use as an upgrade to regular pasta; still, moderate portion (1 cup cooked) and pair with veggies. Could be included 1–2x/week if pasta is typically in your diet.",Prebiotic (fiber)
Whole Grain Pasta (non-wheat),"“Whole grain pasta (non-wheat)” presumably refers to pastas made from whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, spelt, etc. These keep the grain’s fiber and nutrients, thus acting as prebiotic foods. Compared to refined pasta, whole-grain versions lead to more SCFA production in the gut and more stable blood sugar, which is better for cognitive performance. For example, buckwheat or brown rice pasta retains polyphenols that can modulate gut microbes. Overall, a significant improvement over refined flour pasta for microbiome and brain.","Whole-grain diets robustly correlate with lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Whole-grain pastas contribute to that by providing fiber that lowers LDL and improves insulin sensitivity. Non-wheat grains each add their unique nutrients: e.g., buckwheat pasta (soba) contains rutin (good for circulation), brown rice pasta has magnesium, quinoa pasta high protein, etc. They generally cause less of a blood sugar spike than white pasta, helping maintain vascular health. Also, those options allow variety for those with wheat intolerance. Just ensure the product is truly whole grain (some “whole grain blend” pastas may still have refined flour mixed in).",Use in place of regular pasta regularly – can be enjoyed 2–3x/week as part of a high-fiber diet (watch portion and heavy sauces to keep it healthy),Prebiotic (fiber)
Whole Grain Seed Crackers,"These crackers (often made with a mix of whole grains and seeds) are usually high in fiber and provide both soluble and insoluble fiber, serving as prebiotics. They make for a gut-friendly snack compared to refined flour crackers. The seeds contribute extra polyphenols and omega-3 (flax, chia often included), which reduce inflammation and could support cognitive health. Choosing such crackers can help maintain stable energy levels and avoid the sugar crashes from refined snacks, aiding concentration.","The combination of whole grains (oats, quinoa, etc.) and seeds yields a product that improves lipid profiles (due to soluble fiber and omega-3 from seeds) and provides minerals like magnesium and selenium from seeds. These crackers can lower the glycemic load of snacks, supporting better weight management and metabolic health. Many are also gluten-free (using grains like brown rice, millet) which is helpful for those with celiac or sensitivity. They often contain no trans fats and minimal additives, making them a heart-healthy alternative to chips or refined crackers. Just be mindful of sodium content.","1–2 servings (about 6–8 crackers) as a snack or with meals per day, to replace refined snacks (choose varieties with at least 3g fiber per serving)",Prebiotic (fiber)
Whole Wheat Pasta,"Whole wheat pasta retains the wheat bran and germ, making it high in fiber and nutrients. It functions as a prebiotic (with ~6-7g fiber per serving) and leads to a lower glycemic response than white pasta. This means more stable blood glucose and insulin, which is beneficial for brain function and may reduce risk of insulin-resistant dementia. Swapping white for whole wheat pasta in the long term is linked with better cognitive health (owing to overall better diet quality and vascular health).","Offers significantly more satiety and can aid in weight control (people often naturally eat slightly less calories when consuming whole grain pasta due to higher fullness). It contributes to cholesterol reduction and improved digestive regularity. Whole wheat pasta is rich in B-vitamins (if made from unfortified flour, it still has some; many are also enriched on top). One potential downside is some find the taste/texture less palatable, but cooking it correctly (al dente) and pairing with tasty sauces can overcome that. It’s a simple way to increase whole grain intake without major lifestyle changes.","Use as your go-to pasta: 2–3 servings per week or according to personal pasta frequency, replacing refined grain versions. Standard serving ~1 cup cooked (try to keep it around that for calorie control).",Prebiotic (fiber)
"Whole Wheat(berries, flour)","Whole wheat contains all parts of the grain: bran (fiber), germ (nutrients), endosperm. As such, it is a classic prebiotic staple – its arabinoxylan fibers and resistant starch feed beneficial gut bacteria, producing butyrate that supports brain health. Diets high in whole wheat (e.g., traditional breads, bulgur) are associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline due to improvements in vascular health and reduction in diabetes risk. Unless one has celiac, whole wheat is a recommended grain for both gut and brain.","Whole wheat consistently shows benefits in studies: e.g., substituting whole wheat for refined reduces risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The fiber lowers LDL and helps control weight by increasing satiety. The magnesium in whole wheat improves insulin sensitivity. It’s also rich in antioxidants like ferulic acid (especially in the bran) that reduce inflammation. Consumption of whole wheat bread vs white triggers lower insulin response and more sustained energy. Some individuals experience bloating due to fructans in wheat – in those cases, sourdough fermentation or other grains might be better. But for the general population, whole wheat is a cornerstone of the heart-healthy Mediterranean and DASH diets that also benefit brain aging.","Aim for ≥3 servings of whole grains per day (could be from whole wheat bread, pasta, bulgur, etc.) unless medically advised otherwise.",Prebiotic (fiber)
Yellow Catfish,"Yellow catfish (an example of a farmed freshwater fish) is relatively lean and would be a source of quality protein and some omega-3 (though farmed catfish are often fed grain, so they have more omega-6 than wild fish). As with other lean fish, including catfish in one’s diet (especially instead of fried meats) can improve cardiovascular risk factors – beneficial for cognitive health. No special cognitive advantages beyond being a fish (with trace iodine, selenium). Ensure well-cooked as catfish can carry parasites if wild.","Catfish are typically low in mercury and cost-effective. A 4 oz serving provides ~15–20g protein, B12, and some vitamin D (if wild). Farmed catfish, like US farmed channel catfish, have moderate omega-3 (~0.2g/serving) and higher omega-6 – not as ideal as oily fish, but still better than no fish. They do have some taurine and glutamine which might help gut health. From a heart perspective, catfish is fine if not deep fried; blackened or baked catfish is popular and much healthier. It’s a good source of phosphorus and potassium. However, one should watch the source: some imported catfish (basa, swai) have raised concerns about farming practices.","1 serving per week as part of overall fish intake (especially if oily fish options are limited). If fried, limit because frying negates benefits. Blacken or grill for a healthier preparation.",N/A (lean protein)
Yogurt (Fermented),"Yogurt is one of the most accessible probiotic foods, containing live cultures like Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus that improve gut microbiota balance. Numerous studies link regular yogurt intake to better cognitive function in older adults, largely by improving metabolic profiles and reducing inflammation. One study found daily probiotic yogurt improved Mini-Mental State Exam scores in patients with Alzheimer’s over 12 weeks. Yogurt’s probiotics produce GABA and other neuroactive compounds, and its richness in calcium and B vitamins also supports brain health.","Yogurt consumption is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension (likely due to the combination of probiotics and dairy nutrients). It helps with weight maintenance – higher yogurt intake correlates with less weight gain over time. It improves markers of chronic inflammation and endothelial function (a trial showed reduced CRP and endotoxin levels in those consuming probiotic yogurt). Also beneficial for bone health (calcium, vitamin D if fortified, protein). Even lactose-intolerant individuals often tolerate yogurt well because bacteria digest lactose. Choose plain, low-added-sugar varieties to maximize benefits. Greek yogurt offers extra protein which can aid in appetite control and muscle maintenance.","1 cup daily of plain yogurt (or at least ≥3 servings/week). Can be consumed as is, in smoothies, or savory (e.g., tzatziki).",Probiotic (live cultures)
Zucchini,"Zucchini (and other summer squash) has a decent amount of soluble fiber and pectin in the skin, which can have mild prebiotic effects. It’s mostly water (low calorie) but adds bulk and some nutrients. By contributing to overall veggie intake, zucchini aids cognitive health indirectly. It provides lutein and zeaxanthin (especially in the skin) – carotenoids that accumulate in the brain and are linked to better cognitive function in older adults. While not as potent as leafy greens, it’s a valuable part of a diverse plant-rich diet for the brain.","Good for digestion due to fiber and moisture content. Zucchini is gentle on the stomach and can help with hydration. Contains potassium for blood pressure control (though not as much as bananas or potatoes). Because it’s low in calories and carbs, it’s often used as a noodle substitute (“zoodles”), which can help in weight management and blood sugar reduction when replacing pasta – beneficial for heart health. Also provides some vitamin C and folate. Its versatility (grilled, sautéed, in breads) makes it easy to incorporate more vegetables into the diet, supporting overall cardiovascular health.",1 small zucchini (1 cup) a few times per week during season (or more often as a filler veggie – it’s hard to overdo).
